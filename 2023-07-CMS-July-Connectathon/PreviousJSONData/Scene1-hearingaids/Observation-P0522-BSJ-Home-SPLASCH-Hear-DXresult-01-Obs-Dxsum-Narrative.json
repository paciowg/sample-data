  "valueString": "Upon otoscopic examination, bilateral cerumen impaction was noted. Following cerumen removal, no additional abnormalities were noted. Both tympanic membranes were intact and translucent with no visible fluid in the middle ear cavity. Tympanometry revealed bilateral Type-A tympanograms, suggesting normal middle ear function. Audiometric test results revealed bilateral moderate sensorineural hearing loss with relatively poor speech understanding. Mrs. Johnson was fitted with binaural in-the-ear hearing aids, and was offered two weeks of aural rehabilitation therapy"
