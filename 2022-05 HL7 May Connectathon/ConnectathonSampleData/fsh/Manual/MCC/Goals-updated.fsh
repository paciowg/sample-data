She eats an egg and toast each morning, and a neighbor has been bringing over meals at night. However, Betsyâ€™s carb count at lunch and across the afternoon is consistently above the desired limits as she often will have refined food products as a lunch/snack followed by soft drinks and other sugar containing beverages across the afternoon to provide calories as she is fatigued."
